## My Recommendations for Your Dashboard

Based on your HFC insurance review dashboard, I recommend:

### **Option 1: Blue Theme** ‚≠ê (Best Match)
- Professional for insurance/corporate
- Blue already in your brand (blue-500 primary)
- Great for data dashboards
- **This would look most cohesive**

### **Option 2: Slate Theme**
- Professional gray tones
- Better contrast than Neutral
- Clean and corporate
- **Safe, professional choice**

### **Option 3: Zinc Theme**
- Modern gray with warmth
- Good contrast
- Not as "flat" as Neutral
- **Good middle ground**

## How to Switch Themes

**Option A: Let me switch it for you**
Just tell me which theme you want and I'll update the CSS variables in `globals.css`.

**Option B: Quick command (need to backup first)**
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add --overwrite card
```
Then select a different base color when prompted.

**Option C: Custom colors**
We can keep shadcn components but use your custom blue-500 brand colors throughout.

## What I Think Happened

The **Neutral** theme is very minimal and flat, which might be why it's not clicking visually. The borders and shadows are very subtle, making cards blend together.

**Switching to Blue or Slate would:**
- Add more depth with better shadows
- Better color contrast
- More visual hierarchy
- Keep all the component benefits

## What would you like to do?

1. **Switch to Blue theme** (recommended for your brand)
2. **Switch to Slate theme** (professional gray)
3. **Switch to Zinc theme** (modern gray)
4. **Revert to your original custom styles** (before shadcn)
5. **Keep shadcn components but use custom colors** (hybrid approach)

Let me know and I'll make the change! üé®
