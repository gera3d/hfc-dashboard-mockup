## Features

### ðŸ“‹ Display
- **Chat Bubble Design**: Each review appears in a styled card with a chat bubble for the comment
- **Color Coding**:
  - 1â˜… reviews: Red (urgent attention needed)
  - 2â˜… reviews: Orange (needs improvement)
  - 3â˜… reviews: Yellow (room for improvement)
- **Grid Layout**: Responsive 3-column grid (1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop)

- Customer comment in a chat bubble
- Agent who received the review
- Review date

### âœ… Dismiss Functionality
- **X Button**: Each card has an X button in the top-right corner

- **Optional Callback**: Includes `onDismiss` prop for parent components to handle dismissal persistence

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design
- Color-coded backgrounds based on rating severity
- Shadow on hover for better interactivity
- Chat bubble tail for authentic feedback look
- Empty state with encouraging message when no problem reviews exist

## Technical Details

### Component
- **File**: `src/components/dashboard/ProblemFeedback.tsx`
- **Props**:
  ```typescript
  interface ProblemFeedbackProps {
    reviews: Review[];
    onDismiss?: (reviewId: string) => void;
  }
  ```

### Filtering Logic
- Only shows reviews with rating â‰¤ 3
- Only includes reviews with non-empty comments
- Excludes dismissed reviews

### Integration
- Added to `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Positioned after `EnhancedAgentRankings` component
- Uses existing filtered review data

## Usage

The component automatically displays all qualifying reviews. Users can:
1. **Read feedback** from unhappy customers
2. **Dismiss reviews** by clicking the X button
3. **See at a glance** how many problem reviews need attention (badge count)

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Persist dismissed reviews to localStorage
- [ ] Add filtering by agent or date range
- [ ] Add "Mark as resolved" vs "Dismiss" actions
- [ ] Include sentiment analysis or keywords
- [ ] Export problem reviews to CSV
- [ ] Add notes/follow-up actions to reviews
- [ ] Group by agent or department
- [ ] Add priority/severity flags

1. Switch to branch: `git checkout feature/problem-feedback-section`
2. Visit http://localhost:3001/dashboard
3. Look for the "Problem Feedback" section below the agent rankings
