## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### Created:
1. `HFC-THEME-DOCUMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive theme documentation

### Modified:
1. `src/context/ThemeContext.tsx` - Extended from 2 to 3 themes
2. `src/components/tailadmin/common/ThemeToggleButton.tsx` - Complete redesign with dropdown
3. `src/app/globals.css` - Added 200+ lines of HFC theme styles
4. `tailwind.config.mjs` - Added HFC color scales

## 🎨 Color Palette

### HFC Blue Scale (10 shades)
```css
hfc-50  → hfc-900  (lightest to darkest blue)
Primary: hfc-500 (#0066CC)
```

### HFC Green Scale (10 shades)
```css
hfc-green-50 → hfc-green-900 (lightest to darkest green)
Primary: hfc-green-500 (#00CA6F)
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User clicks theme icon in top navigation
2. Dropdown shows 3 theme options with icons
3. User selects "HFC" theme
4. Dashboard instantly applies Health for California branding
5. Theme preference saved to localStorage
6. Persists across page refreshes

### Technical Flow:
```typescript
ThemeContext.tsx
  ↓
Theme state: 'light' | 'dark' | 'hfc'
  ↓
Add/remove class on <html>: .hfc
  ↓
globals.css applies .hfc styles
  ↓
All components inherit brand colors
```
