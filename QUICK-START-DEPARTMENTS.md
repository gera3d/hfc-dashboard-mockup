# Quick Start: Managing Agent Departments

## The Simple Way

Every agent in your dashboard has a department dropdown **right in their row** of the Agent Performance table.

### To Change an Agent's Department:
1. Find the agent in the table
2. Click their department dropdown (2nd column)
3. Pick a new department
4. Done! ✅

### To Create a New Department:
1. Click any agent's department dropdown
2. Select **"+ Create New Department"** at the bottom
3. Type the department name (e.g., "Life Insurance")
4. Press Enter or click Create
5. Agent is now in that department ✅

## Where is it?

Scroll down past the charts to the **"Agent Performance"** table. Look at the second column labeled "DEPARTMENT" - those are all dropdowns!

## Examples

**Moving BillyH from IFP to Medicare:**
- Click BillyH's department dropdown
- Select "Medicare/Small Biz"
- BillyH moves to Medicare section

**Creating a "Life Insurance" department:**
- Click any dropdown
- Select "+ Create New Department"
- Type: "Life Insurance"
- The agent moves there immediately
- Now all agents can be assigned to Life Insurance

## What Updates Automatically?

When you change departments:
- ✅ Agent moves to new section in table
- ✅ Department subtotals recalculate
- ✅ Charts update (Department Comparison, Problem Spotlight)
- ✅ All reviews for that agent update
- ✅ No page refresh needed

## Important Note

Changes save **locally** in your browser session. To make them permanent:
1. Note which changes you made
2. Update your Google Sheet manually
3. Click "Sync from Sheets" to reload

This keeps your dashboard responsive while you organize your team!
