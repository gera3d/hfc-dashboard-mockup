# HFC Reviews Dashboard · World-Class UX/UI Masterplan

**Date:** September 27, 2025  
**Prepared by:** Principal Product Design Practice (External Advisory)  
**Scope:** Elevate the HFC Reviews dashboard (Next.js 15 + Tailwind) into a flagship-quality web application that exudes trust, speed, and delight while aligning with enterprise accessibility and brand standards.

---

## 1. Executive Vision

The reimagined HFC Reviews dashboard must function as the single source of truth for reputational intelligence. The experience should:

- **Feel inevitable**: Information density handled with effortless clarity; the platform anticipates the user’s next question.
- **Be unmistakably HFC**: Visual language reflects HFC’s bold, optimistic banking brand while signaling innovation and transparency.
- **Be radically inclusive**: Every interaction is accessible, responsive, and pleasant across assistive technologies and devices.
- **Be performance obsessed**: Sub-second feedback for critical actions, smooth transitions, and intelligent prefetching.

### Target Outcomes

- Increase weekly active usage by **+35%** through higher perceived mastery and trust.
- Cut time-to-insight for CX leads from 7 minutes → **< 2 minutes** via re-prioritized visual hierarchy.
- Achieve **Lighthouse ≥ 95** across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.
- Sustain NPS **≥ +45** in quarterly stakeholder surveys.

## 2. Experience Principles

1. **Precision with Personality** – Data-dense dashboards can be charismatic. Pair rigorous structure with moments of warmth (microcopy, ambient motion, tasteful gradients).  
2. **Confidence at a Glance** – Top-level KPIs must resolve decisive questions instantly; deeper layers are one click away.  
3. **Composable Storytelling** – Every module is a Lego brick: filters, KPIs, charts, and tables can be rearranged without breaking flows.  
4. **Always in Control** – Users understand current context (filters, timeframe, agent) and can reverse decisions without anxiety.  
5. **Inclusion by Default** – Accessibility enhancements launch alongside features, never as a retrofit.

## 3. Audiences & Signature Moments

| Persona | Primary Jobs to be Done | Signature Moment | Required Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CX Ops Director** | Benchmark agents, escalate negative trends | Macro-level KPI wall with colored narrative overlays | Insightful, board-ready story in <3 minutes |
| **Regional Manager** | Coach agents, celebrate wins | Drill into agent profile with trend sparklines & coaching notes | Context-rich performance review in <5 minutes |
| **Support Lead** | Respond to urgent reviews | Dynamic queue with sentiment tagging & reply playbooks | Zero-inbox workflow, 1-click response templates |

Signature moments must have tailored visuals (illustrative icons, micro animations) to reinforce emotional resonance.

---

## 4. Visual Language Blueprint

### 4.1 Color System (extend `src/lib/design-tokens.ts`)

| Token | Hex | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brand.primary` | `#0043CE` | Actionable elements, primary CTAs |
| `brand.accent` | `#3DDC97` | Highlights, positive trends |
| `brand.alert` | `#FF6B6B` | Warnings, negative trends |
| `brand.neutral-900` | `#0B1F33` | Headings, high-contrast text |
| `brand.neutral-700` | `#284966` | Secondary text, chart axes |
| `brand.neutral-200` | `#E0E8F2` | Borders, dividers |
| `background.base` | `#F5F7FA` | App shell background |
| `background.surface` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.82)` | Glass surfaces, cards |
| `background.surface-strong` | `#FFFFFF` | High-emphasis cards |
| `signal.gold` | `#F9C846` | 4★ highlight |
| `signal.platinum` | `#00ADEF` | Top performer badge |

> **Action:** Populate these tokens in `design-tokens.ts`, expose them via Tailwind CSS custom properties, and update `globals.css` for consistent application.

### 4.2 Typography Stack

| Style | Font | Tailwind Class | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Display | _Clash Display_ (variable) | `font-display` | Hero headlines, KPI titles |
| Sans | _Inter_ | `font-sans` | Body copy, tables |
| Mono | _IBM Plex Mono_ | `font-mono` | Data labels, numeric codes |

- Establish fluid type scale: clamp formula e.g., `$\text{clamp}(1rem, 0.85rem + 0.8vw, 2rem)$`.  
- Add `font-display` class in `tailwind.config` and load variable fonts via `next/font` in `layout.tsx`.

### 4.3 Layout & Elevation

- **Spatial rhythm**: Adopt an 8px baseline grid. Use 24/32px macro-padding for sections.  
- **Elevation tiers**:  
  - Level 0 (background): no shadow, subtle gradient overlay.  
  - Level 1 (cards): `shadow-lg shadow-brand-primary/5`, 12px blur, 1.5px border with 12% white overlay for glass effect.  
  - Level 2 (modals, dropdowns): `shadow-2xl`, 16px radius, tinted glass.

### 4.4 Iconography & Imagery

- Integrate `lucide-react` icons with consistent stroke width (1.75px).  
- Create custom achievement badges using `public/globe.svg` style to celebrate agent milestones.  
- Replace placeholder gradients with subtle aurora textures exported as 2kb webp backgrounds to reduce reliance on heavy CSS gradients.

---

## 5. Component System Enhancements

### 5.1 Navigation & Header (`src/app/page.tsx`)

- Introduce **Command Bar**: global search anchored top-right (`Ctrl + K`), quick actions for filter presets.  
- Add **multi-level breadcrumb** component referencing App Router segments.  
- Integrate real-time status indicator (Connected, Syncing, Offline) with WebSocket hook.

### 5.2 Global Filters (`src/components/GlobalFilters.tsx`)

- Convert to **Docked filter rail** (left column) with collapsible sections; maintain floating pill summary below header for quick scanning.  
- Provide **scenario presets** (e.g., "Escalations last 7 days") as chips at top, using `ToggleGroup` pattern.  
- Add **filter diff** visual when comparison mode active (color-coded badges showing delta step).

### 5.3 KPI Tiles (`src/components/KPITiles.tsx`)

- Create multi-layer tile:  
  - Upper portion: large numeric display with `clamp(2rem, 3vw, 3.5rem)` font.  
  - Lower portion: Sparkline (using `recharts` `AreaChart` with gradient fill).  
- Introduce **momentum tails**: If trend is positive > 8%, animate gradient sweep from left to right (1.2s linear).  
- Provide inline **haptic cues**: On hover/focus, tile gently lifts (`transform translateY(-4px) scale(1.01)`).

### 5.4 Charts (`src/components/Charts.tsx`)

- Layer a **context band** behind primary line/area to highlight goal thresholds.  
- Add **tooltip choreography**: Multi-series comparison with keyboard accessible focus ring around points.  
- Provide **annotation system** (API-ready) enabling stakeholders to pin events (e.g., campaign launch).  
- Offer **visual themes** (Performance, Satisfaction, Volume) toggled via segmented control.

### 5.5 Tables (`src/components/DataTables.tsx`)

- Introduce **Modular column templates**: define schema in TypeScript (id, label, formatter, priority).  
- Implement **progressive disclosure**: default view shows critical metrics; row expansion reveals advanced analytics.  
- Integrate **sticky summary row** (top or bottom) showing medians/averages.  
- Add **inline actions** (Assign, Flag, Celebrate) with icon-only buttons and accessible labels.  
- Provide **empty state** illustrations with friendly tone.

### 5.6 Agent Detail Page (`src/app/agent/[id]/page.tsx`)

- Elevate hero card with portrait placeholder, agent sentiment gauge (semi-circular).  
- Embed **coaching timeline**: timeline component with moments highlighted; integrate `reviews.ts` data for narrative context.  
- Add **shareable insights export** (PDF/email) accessible from top-right.

---

## 6. Interaction & Motion System

- Define **motion tokens** (`motion.duration.short`, `motion.easing.out`, etc.) consumed via `useAnimations.ts`.  
- Standardize transitions:  
  - **Navigation transitions**: 180ms fade + 60px upward spring.  
  - **Filter updates**: 120ms crossfade with skeleton shimmer.  
  - **Modal surfaces**: 200ms scale-in, 16px overshoot, 0.82 opacity overlay.  
- Create **micro-interaction library**:  
  - Hover states with 3D tilt on cards (limited to 4°).  
  - Ripple effect on primary CTAs (12px radial).  
  - Loading placeholders for tables and charts using shimmering rows aligned to baseline grid.

---

## 7. Accessibility & Inclusive Design

- Conform to **WCAG 2.2 AA** (prepare for AAA contrast where achievable).  
- Implement **semantic HTML scaffolding**: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `aside`, `section` wrappers.  
- Enforce **focus-visible** states with custom ring tokens tied to brand palette.  
- Provide **keyboard shortcuts matrix** (toggle panel with `?`).  
- Add **Live Region** announcements for async updates (filters applied, data refreshed).  
- Include **voice narration** summary for charts (ARIA `aria-describedby` referencing accessible text).  
- Test using axe-core CI integration and manual assistive tech sweeps (NVDA, VoiceOver).

---

## 8. Responsive & Adaptive Strategy

- **Breakpoints**: XS (<480), SM (480-639), MD (640-1023), LG (1024-1439), XL (1440+).  
- **Adaptive layout**:  
  - Mobile: KPI carousel with swipe, stacked cards, sticky filter button bottom-right.  
  - Tablet: Two-column masonry layout (filters collapsible).  
  - Desktop: 12-column CSS Grid via Tailwind `grid-cols-12`, dynamic spans for modules.  
- Introduce **density toggle** (Comfortable, Compact) altering padding and font-size tokens.  
- Ensure tables degrade to **card stacks** with summary chips and toggled detail accordion.

---

## 9. Data Visualization Excellence

- Define **chart theming** in a central config (colors, stroke widths, gridline opacity).  
- Use **"Small Multiple"** approach for department comparisons: repeated mini charts for quick scanning.  
- Add **threshold markers** (line for target NPS, dot for previous period).  
- Integrate **variance storytelling**: color-coded bands showing deviation vs. goal.  
- Provide **download options** (CSV, PNG) with consistent iconography.  
- Build **zero-state patterns**:  
  - No data yet → friendly illustration + guidance  
  - Loading → skeleton  
  - Error → card with retry CTA and contact support link.

---

## 10. Content & Microcopy Strategy

- Establish tone-of-voice: **Assured, empathetic, actionable**.  
- Create copy system for tooltips, empty states, alerts, trend labels (positive/neutral/negative).  
- Provide **data storytelling subtitles** under each chart ("Satisfaction peaked after concierge training – up 12% WoW").  
- Introduce **celebratory language** triggered on threshold achievements ("5★ streak unlocked").

---

## 11. Technical Enablers

- Populate `design-tokens.ts` and `theme-config.ts`, expose via context provider.  
- Extend Tailwind config with CSS variables for tokens (`--color-brand-primary`).  
- Implement **Theme Orchestrator**:  
  - Light, Dark, and High-Contrast modes.  
  - Persisted preference in localStorage, server-synced for logged-in users.  
- Introduce **State machine** (XState or simple reducer) for filters, ensuring deterministic transitions.  
- Adopt **Storybook** for component documentation with themed backgrounds and accessibility add-ons.  
- Enforce design linting (Stylelint + custom token usage plugin) to avoid ad-hoc colors.

---

## 12. Measurement & Feedback Loop

- Instrument analytics events: filter applications, KPI hover, chart annotation usage, export actions.  
- Implement **Session Replay** (FullStory or native) for UX research with redaction for PII.  
- Add **Feedback beacon**: micro survey widget anchored bottom-right capturing confidence, friction points, ideas.  
- Run quarterly **Benchmark Studies** measuring task completion + SUS.
