## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**
   - Go to `/dashboard`
   
2. **Click Help Button**
   - Look for blue "Performance Tiers Guide" button above the metrics
   - Should be in the top-right area
   
3. **Explore Modal**
   - View the 4 tier cards with icons and descriptions
   - Scroll to see all metric thresholds
   - Click X or outside modal to close

## 📝 Next Steps (Not Yet Complete)

### Phase 2: Update EnhancedMetricsGrid Component
The `EnhancedMetricsGrid.tsx` component needs to be updated to:
- ❌ Remove fire emoji (🔥)
- ❌ Remove "Surge" badges  
- ❌ Apply consistent Elite/Excellent/Good/Needs Attention labels
- ❌ Update all 4 cards to use new tier functions
- ❌ Use correct icons (Sparkles, Award, ThumbsUp, AlertTriangle)
- ❌ Apply tier-based styling (purple for Elite, green for Excellent, etc.)

**Complexity**: This is a large component (~900 lines) with 4 cards that each need:
- Status calculation functions
- Dynamic styling based on tier
- Icon switching based on tier
- Color scheme updates
- Badge rendering

### Phase 3: Test with Real Data
- ❌ Verify tiers display correctly
- ❌ Test edge cases (exactly on threshold boundaries)
- ❌ Validate colors and styling
- ❌ Check dark mode appearance

## 🎯 Current Status

### What Works Right Now:
✅ Help button visible on dashboard
✅ Modal opens with full tier system explanation
✅ All thresholds clearly documented
✅ Beautiful visual design
✅ No errors, ready to use

### What Still Shows Old Labels:
⚠️ The actual metric cards still show:
- "Excellent/Good/Fair/Needs Attention" (mixed terminology)
- Fire emoji for reviews
- "Elite" only on rating card
- Need consistent system across all 4 cards

## 💡 Recommendation

**Current State**: The help system is fully functional and can be used right now to educate users about the tier system.

**Next Action**: When ready to update the actual metrics display, we'll need to carefully refactor `EnhancedMetricsGrid.tsx` to apply the unified tier system to all 4 cards. This is a significant but straightforward update - we have the tier logic ready, just need to apply it systematically.

For now, you can:
1. Test the help modal
2. Review the tier definitions
3. Provide feedback on thresholds or styling
4. Decide if you want to proceed with updating the metrics cards
