# KPI Metrics Selection - Business Owner's Dashboard

## Why These Four Metrics?

### The Business Owner's Core Questions

Every business owner reviewing customer feedback wants to know:

1. **"Are my customers happy?"** ‚Üí Customer Satisfaction (5-star rate)
2. **"Am I getting enough feedback?"** ‚Üí Total Reviews  
3. **"What's my reputation?"** ‚Üí Average Rating
4. **"What needs my attention NOW?"** ‚Üí Problem Reviews

These four metrics provide a complete picture of customer experience health without overwhelming the viewer.

## Metric Selection Criteria

### ‚úÖ What Made the Cut

Each metric was chosen based on:

1. **Actionability**: Can the owner DO something about it?
2. **Urgency**: Does it require timely attention?
3. **Impact**: Does it directly affect business outcomes?
4. **Clarity**: Is it immediately understandable?
5. **Completeness**: Does it contribute unique information?

### ‚ùå What Didn't Make the Cut (and why)

**Individual Star Counts (1-5 stars separately)**
- ‚ùå Too granular for executive view
- ‚ùå Creates analysis paralysis
- ‚úÖ Better: Rolled into "Customer Satisfaction" and "Problem Reviews"

**Source-Specific Metrics**
- ‚ùå Splits attention across channels
- ‚ùå Not actionable at the top level
- ‚úÖ Better: Available in drill-down sections below

**Time-Based Metrics (MTD, YTD, etc.)**
- ‚ùå Context-dependent, needs explanation
- ‚ùå Comparison mode handles this better
- ‚úÖ Better: Use time period selector + comparison mode

**Response Rate**
- ‚ùå Not all businesses respond to reviews
- ‚ùå Secondary metric, not critical
- ‚úÖ Better: Available in detailed analytics

**Sentiment Score**
- ‚ùå Requires ML/NLP, adds complexity
- ‚ùå Already captured by star ratings
- ‚úÖ Better: Could be future enhancement

## The Four Chosen Metrics - Deep Dive

### 1. Customer Satisfaction (5-Star Rate)

**Formula**: `(5-star reviews / total reviews) √ó 100`

**Why this is primary:**
- üéØ Industry standard benchmark
- üéØ Directly correlates with customer loyalty
- üéØ Easy to understand and communicate
- üéØ Used by Google, Amazon, and other platforms

**Business Impact:**
- **90%+ (Excellent)**: Customer loyalty is strong, word-of-mouth marketing active
- **75-89% (Good)**: Solid performance, room for improvement
- **60-74% (Fair)**: Warning signs, investigate service issues
- **<60% (Poor)**: Critical business problem, immediate action required

**Decision Logic:**
```typescript
if (fiveStarRate >= 90) {
  // GREEN CELEBRATION MODE
  // Show green gradient, "Excellent" badge
  // This is PR-worthy, share internally
}
else if (fiveStarRate >= 75) {
  // NORMAL MODE
  // Business is healthy, continue monitoring
}
else if (fiveStarRate >= 60) {
  // WARNING MODE
  // Start investigating, review processes
}
else {
  // CRITICAL MODE
  // Emergency meeting, immediate intervention
}
```

### 2. Total Reviews (Volume)

**Formula**: `COUNT(all reviews in period)`

**Why volume matters:**
- üìä More reviews = more data = better insights
- üìä Review volume affects search rankings (SEO)
- üìä Social proof - customers trust businesses with many reviews
- üìä Indicates customer engagement level

**Business Impact:**
- **Increasing**: Marketing working, customer engagement up
- **Decreasing**: Warning sign - investigate customer touchpoints
- **Spike (+20%)**: Major win - campaign success or viral moment
- **Drop (-20%)**: Problem - fewer customers or engagement issues

**Decision Logic:**
```typescript
const volumeChange = (current - previous) / previous * 100;

if (volumeChange >= 20) {
  // üî• ON FIRE MODE
  // Show fire emoji, celebrate momentum
  // Sustain whatever is working
}
else if (volumeChange <= -20) {
  // üìâ CONCERN MODE
  // Investigate: seasonal? campaign ended? problem?
}
else {
  // NORMAL MODE
  // Steady state, continue monitoring
}
```

**Why 20% threshold?**
- Natural variation is typically 5-15%
- 20%+ indicates significant change
- Warrants investigation or celebration

---

### 3. Average Rating (Quality)

**Formula**: `SUM(all ratings) / COUNT(reviews)`

**Why include when we have satisfaction?**
- ‚≠ê Displayed on ALL review platforms (Google, Yelp, etc.)
- ‚≠ê First thing potential customers see
- ‚≠ê Different insight than 5-star rate
  - Satisfaction = excellence rate
  - Average = overall quality level
- ‚≠ê Helps identify "4-star creep" (good but not great)

**Business Impact:**
- **4.8+ (Exceptional)**: Elite tier, competitive advantage
- **4.5-4.7 (Very Good)**: Strong performance
- **4.0-4.4 (Good)**: Acceptable but improvable
- **<4.0 (Poor)**: Reputation risk

**Real-World Example:**
```
Business A: 70% 5-star, 30% 3-star ‚Üí Avg: 4.4
Business B: 50% 5-star, 50% 4-star ‚Üí Avg: 4.5

Both have room to improve, but B is more consistent.
Average rating captures this nuance.
```

**Decision Logic:**
```typescript
if (avgRating >= 4.8) {
  // ‚≠ê EXCEPTIONAL MODE
  // This is a competitive differentiator
  // Feature in marketing materials
}
else {
  // NORMAL MODE
  // Good performance, keep improving
}
```

### 4. Problem Reviews (1‚òÖ + 2‚òÖ)

**Formula**: `COUNT(1-star reviews) + COUNT(2-star reviews)`

**Why separate from satisfaction?**
- üö® Each problem review represents a dissatisfied customer
- üö® Can escalate to public disputes, reputation damage
- üö® Requires different action (response, service recovery)
- üö® More urgent than overall satisfaction trends

**Why 1 & 2 star only?**
- 3-star is neutral/mixed (not necessarily a problem)
- 1-2 star indicates clear dissatisfaction
- These are the reviews that damage reputation

**Business Impact:**
- **0 problems**: Celebrate internally
- **1-10 problems**: Normal friction, monitor and respond
- **11+ problems**: Review required, identify patterns
- **Increasing trend**: CRITICAL - systematic issue

**Decision Logic:**
```typescript
const isIncreasing = problemReviews > previousProblems;
const problemCount = problemReviews;

if (isIncreasing) {
  // üö® CRITICAL ALERT MODE
  // Red background, shake animation, pulse effect
  // Drop everything, investigate immediately
  // Potential causes:
  //   - New employee needs training
  //   - Process breakdown
  //   - Product quality issue
  //   - Competitor sabotage (yes, it happens)
}
else if (problemCount > 10) {
  // ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING MODE
  // Orange styling, review badge
  // Schedule time to review and respond
}
else if (problemCount === 0) {
  // ‚úÖ CLEAR MODE
  // Green badge, neutral styling
  // Keep doing what you're doing
}
else {
  // NORMAL MODE
  // Some problems are expected
  // Monitor and respond as needed
}
```

**Why the shake animation?**
- Problems increasing = URGENT
- Needs to interrupt the owner's attention
- But not panic - controlled, purposeful animation
- Signals: "Look at me NOW, but don't freak out"

## Comparison Mode (vs. Last Period)

### Why Include Trends?

**Static numbers lack context:**
- "96.1% satisfaction" - is that good? improving?
- "2,379 reviews" - is that a lot? growing?

**Trends provide direction:**
- ‚Üë 0.13% - small win, on the right track
- ‚Üì 5.41% - concern, investigate
- ‚Üë 12.50% problems - ALARM, take action

### Trend Badge Colors

**Green = Good News**
- ‚úÖ Satisfaction UP
- ‚úÖ Reviews UP  
- ‚úÖ Rating UP
- ‚úÖ Problems DOWN

**Red = Bad News**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Satisfaction DOWN
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Reviews DOWN
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rating DOWN
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Problems UP

### When to Show Trends
- Always available via "Comparison Mode" toggle
- Only shown when meaningful data exists
- Clearly labeled "vs last period" for context

- Amber highlighting for exceptional ratings
- Rewards good performance
- Motivates continued excellence

**Design Goal**: Recognize wins, build momentum

### Alert State: Focused Urgency

- Shake animation for attention
- Pulsing border for persistence
- Clear "ALERT" badge
- Demands attention without panic

**Design Goal**: Get attention NOW, enable quick action

## Information Hierarchy

### Primary: The Big Number
- Largest text (text-title-xl on desktop)
- Bold weight
- High contrast
- Animated count-up on load

**What the owner sees first**

### Secondary: The Label
- Smaller text, uppercase
- Medium gray (until special state)
- Tracking-wide for readability

**What the number means**

### Tertiary: The Context
- Smallest text
- Supporting information
- "5-star rate", "all sources", "out of 5.0", "1‚òÖ+2‚òÖ"

**Additional details**

### Quaternary: The Trend
- Badge + arrow + percentage
- Comparison data
- Color-coded for quick scanning

**Change over time**

## Mobile Optimization

### Constraints
- Smaller screen (often < 400px wide)
- Touch targets need to be larger
- Less space for text
- Users often on-the-go

### Adaptations
- 2x2 grid instead of 4 columns
- Smaller padding (p-3 vs p-6)
- Reduced font sizes
- Essential info only
- Touch-friendly targets

### What's Preserved
- All four metrics visible
- Icons and badges
- Primary numbers
- Color coding and alerts

### What's Hidden
- Some secondary labels
- Detailed hover tooltips
- "vs last period" text (badge remains)

## Future Considerations

### Personalization
- Let owners set their own alert thresholds
- Custom metrics based on business type
- Industry benchmarks for comparison

### Drill-Down

### Goal Tracking
- Set targets (e.g., "Reach 95% satisfaction")
- Show progress indicators
- Celebrate milestones

### Notifications
- Email/SMS alerts for critical issues
- Daily/weekly summaries
- Custom notification rules

### Predictive Insights
- "At this rate, you'll hit 90% satisfaction in 2 weeks"
- "Problem reviews are trending up, investigate"
