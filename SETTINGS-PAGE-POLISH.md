## Design Philosophy

### Before (Problems):
- Cluttered dashboard header with 3+ action buttons
- Mixed concerns: analytics + data management + settings
- Sidebar taking up valuable screen space
- Local changes alert interrupting dashboard flow

### After (Solutions):
1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Dashboard = View & analyze data
   - Settings = Manage & sync data
   
2. **Focused UI**
   - Every component has a specific purpose
   - No redundant or "just in case" features
   
3. **Clean Navigation**
   - Top nav for branding + essential actions only
   - Settings page for all management tasks
   
4. **Better Space Usage**
   - No sidebar = more room for charts and tables
   - Fixed top nav = consistent navigation
   - Settings page = dedicated space for complex operations

---

## User Flow

### Analytics Workflow:
1. User lands on dashboard
2. Uses global filters to select date range, departments, etc.
3. Views charts, metrics, and agent rankings
4. Clicks agent cards to view details
5. Explores data tables

### Management Workflow:
1. User clicks "Settings" in top nav
2. Views local changes alert (if any exist)
3. Can sync from Google Sheets
4. Can refresh local cache
5. Can manage agent departments
6. Can reset changes or push to Sheets (planned)
7. Returns to dashboard via back button or logo click
