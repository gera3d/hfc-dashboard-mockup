# Department Analytics Module

## Overview

A comprehensive department analytics dashboard featuring multiple chart types and performance metrics. Built using **Recharts** based on Context7 research to identify the most effective visualizations for departmental performance data.

## Research & Technology Selection

### Context7 Analysis

Used Context7 to research the best charting solutions:
- **Searched 60+ libraries and dashboards**
- **Selected Recharts** (already installed):
  - 92 code snippets
  - Trust score: 8.2
  - Version: 3.2.1
  - Excellent documentation with working examples

### Chart Type Selection

Based on Context7 research and best practices from top-rated dashboard examples:

1. **Horizontal Bar Chart** - Side-by-side department comparison
2. **Radar Chart** - Multi-dimensional performance analysis
3. **Composed Chart** - Volume (bars) + Quality (line) overlay
4. **Overview Cards** - Key statistics and top/bottom performers

## Components

### 1. DepartmentAnalyticsDashboard (Main Container)

**Location:** `src/components/department/DepartmentAnalyticsDashboard.tsx`

**Purpose:** Main container that processes review data and orchestrates all department analytics visualizations.

**Key Features:**
- Processes raw review data into department metrics
- Filters departments with zero reviews
- Sorts data appropriately for each chart type
- Provides comprehensive overview and insights
- Responsive layout with empty states

**Metrics Calculated:**
```typescript
{
  departmentName: string;
  totalReviews: number;
  avgRating: number;
  fiveStarRate: number;
  problemRate: number;
  problemReviews: number;
  customerSatisfaction: number;
  responseRate: number;
}
```

**Props:**
```typescript
interface DepartmentAnalyticsDashboardProps {
  reviews: Review[];
  departments: Department[];
}
```

**Usage:**
```tsx
<DepartmentAnalyticsDashboard 
  reviews={filteredData} 
  departments={departments} 
/>
```

### 2. DepartmentMetricsBarChart

**Location:** `src/components/department/DepartmentMetricsBarChart.tsx`

**Purpose:** Horizontal bar chart for easy department name reading and performance comparison.

**Key Features:**
- **Horizontal layout** (`layout="vertical"`) for readability
- **100px left margin** to accommodate department names
- **Two bar series**:
  - Total Reviews (blue)
  - 5-Star Rate (color-coded by performance)
- **Color coding:**
  - Green: ≥90% (excellent)
  - Blue: 75-89% (good)
  - Amber: 60-74% (needs improvement)
  - Red: <60% (critical)
- **CartesianGrid** for easy value reading
- **Custom tooltip** with formatted percentages
- **Legend** explaining color meanings

**Pattern from Context7:**
```tsx
<ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={400}>
  <BarChart data={data} layout="vertical" margin={{ left: 100 }}>
    <Bar dataKey="fiveStarRate">
      {data.map((entry, index) => (
        <Cell fill={getBarColor(entry.fiveStarRate)} />
      ))}
    </Bar>
  </BarChart>
</ResponsiveContainer>
```

### 3. DepartmentRadarChart

**Location:** `src/components/department/DepartmentRadarChart.tsx`

**Purpose:** Multi-dimensional performance comparison across 5 key metrics.

**Key Features:**
- **5 normalized metrics** (all scaled to 0-100):
  1. 5-Star Rate (direct percentage)
  2. Avg Rating (converted: rating/5 × 100)
  3. Customer Satisfaction (4-5 star percentage)
  4. Response Rate (placeholder - 85%)
  5. Volume (relative to highest: reviews/max × 100)

- **6-color palette** for department overlay
- **PolarGrid** for metric structure
- **PolarAngleAxis** for metric labels
- **PolarRadiusAxis** hidden (cleaner look)
- **Opacity 0.3** for overlapping areas
- **Explanatory note** on how to read the chart

**Why Radar Charts?**
From Context7 research: Radar charts excel at showing multiple dimensions simultaneously, making it easy to spot strengths/weaknesses across categories at a glance.

**Pattern from Context7:**
```tsx
<RadarChart data={radarData}>
  <PolarGrid />
  <PolarAngleAxis dataKey="metric" />
  <PolarRadiusAxis />
  {departments.map((dept, index) => (
    <Radar
      name={dept.departmentName}
      dataKey={dept.departmentName}
      stroke={colors[index]}
      fill={colors[index]}
      fillOpacity={0.3}
    />
  ))}
</RadarChart>
```

---

### 4. DepartmentComposedChart

**Location:** `src/components/department/DepartmentComposedChart.tsx`

**Purpose:** Show relationship between review volume (bars) and quality metrics (lines).

**Key Features:**
- **Dual Y-axes:**
  - Left: Review count (0 to max)
  - Right: Rating (0 to 5 stars)
- **Bar series:**
  - Total Reviews (blue, 80% opacity)
  - Problem Reviews (red, 80% opacity)
- **Line series:**
  - Average Rating (green, 3px stroke)
- **45° rotated X-axis labels** for department names
- **Rounded bar tops** (radius: [8, 8, 0, 0])
- **Insight box** explaining how to interpret the chart

**Why Composed Charts?**
From Context7 research: Composed charts are ideal for showing correlations between different metric types (volume vs. quality), helping identify patterns like "high volume, low quality" that need attention.

**Pattern from Context7:**
```tsx
<ComposedChart data={data}>
  <Bar yAxisId="left" dataKey="totalReviews" fill="#3b82f6" />
  <Bar yAxisId="left" dataKey="problemReviews" fill="#ef4444" />
  <Line yAxisId="right" dataKey="avgRating" stroke="#22c55e" />
</ComposedChart>
```

### 5. DepartmentOverviewCards

**Location:** `src/components/department/DepartmentOverviewCards.tsx`

**Purpose:** High-level KPIs and department performance highlights.

**Key Features:**
- **4 summary cards:**
  1. Total Reviews (MessageSquare icon, blue)
  2. Overall Rating (Star icon, yellow)
  3. Customer Satisfaction (CheckCircle icon, green)
  4. Problem Reviews (AlertCircle icon, red)

- **Trend indicators** (up/down arrows) based on thresholds
- **Color-coded backgrounds** matching card type
- **Icon backgrounds** with subtle opacity

- **2 highlight cards:**
  - **Top Performer** (green gradient) - Highest 5-star rate
  - **Needs Attention** (amber gradient) - Most problem reviews

- **Responsive grid:**
  - Mobile: 1 column
  - Tablet: 2 columns
  - Desktop: 4 columns

**Design Pattern:**
Cards use gradient backgrounds and Icons from lucide-react for a modern, professional appearance. Hover effects add interactivity.

## Integration

### Dashboard Page Integration

**Location:** `src/app/page.tsx`

**Placement:** After Department Comparison & Problem Spotlight section, before Detailed Reports

```tsx
import { DepartmentAnalyticsDashboard } from '@/components/department/DepartmentAnalyticsDashboard'

// ...

<div className="mb-12">
  <DepartmentAnalyticsDashboard 
    reviews={filteredData} 
    departments={departments} 
  />
</div>
```

---

## Data Processing

### Review Filtering
```typescript
const deptReviews = reviews.filter((r) => r.department_id === dept.id);
```

### Metric Calculations

**5-Star Rate:**
```typescript
const fiveStarRate = (fiveStarReviews / totalReviews) * 100;
```

**Customer Satisfaction:** (4-5 stars)
```typescript
const customerSatisfaction = (satisfiedReviews / totalReviews) * 100;
```

**Average Rating:**
```typescript
const avgRating = reviews.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.rating, 0) / totalReviews;
```

**Problem Rate:** (1-3 stars)
```typescript
const problemRate = (problemReviews / totalReviews) * 100;
```

### Radar Chart Normalization

All metrics converted to 0-100 scale for fair comparison:

```typescript
{
  '5-Star Rate': fiveStarRate, // Already 0-100
  'Avg Rating': (avgRating / 5) * 100, // Convert 0-5 to 0-100
  'Customer Sat.': customerSatisfaction, // Already 0-100
  'Response Rate': responseRate, // Already 0-100
  'Volume': (totalReviews / maxReviews) * 100 // Relative to highest
}
```

## Design Patterns from Context7

### ResponsiveContainer (Universal)
All charts wrapped in ResponsiveContainer for automatic sizing:
```tsx
<ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={400}>
  {/* Chart content */}
</ResponsiveContainer>
```

### CartesianGrid (Readability)
Adds grid lines for easier value reading:
```tsx
<CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" className="stroke-gray-200 dark:stroke-gray-700" />
```

### Custom Tooltips (Consistency)
Formatted tooltips with consistent styling:
```tsx
<Tooltip 
  contentStyle={{ 
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)', 
    border: '1px solid #e5e7eb',
    borderRadius: '8px'
  }}
  formatter={(value, name) => [formatValue(value), formatName(name)]}
/>
```

### Cell-Based Color Coding (Visual Hierarchy)
Individual bar colors based on data:
```tsx
<Bar dataKey="fiveStarRate">
  {data.map((entry, index) => (
    <Cell key={`cell-${index}`} fill={getBarColor(entry.fiveStarRate)} />
  ))}
</Bar>
```

### Dark Mode Support
All components use Tailwind's `dark:` variants:
```tsx
className="text-gray-800 dark:text-white"
```

---

## Key Insights Section

The dashboard includes an automated insights section that highlights:

1. **Highest 5-Star Rate** - Best performing department
2. **Most Reviews** - Highest volume department
3. **Best Response Rate** - Most responsive department

These are calculated dynamically and update with filtered data.

---

## Accessibility Features

From Recharts 3.0+ (Context7 documentation):
- **Keyboard navigation** built-in
- **Screen reader support** for data points
- **ARIA labels** for chart elements
- **Focus indicators** on interactive elements

---

## Performance Considerations

### useMemo for Calculations
All expensive calculations wrapped in useMemo:
```typescript
const departmentMetrics = useMemo(() => {
  // Process all department data
}, [reviews, departments]);
```

### Conditional Rendering
Empty state shown when no department data available:
```typescript
if (departmentMetrics.length === 0) {
  return <EmptyState />;
}
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Time-based Area Chart** - Show department trends over time
2. **Heatmap** - Hour/day patterns by department
3. **Treemap** - Visual hierarchy of departments by size/performance
4. **Export functionality** - Download charts as images/PDFs
5. **Drill-down** - Click department to see detailed agent breakdown
6. **Comparison mode** - Select 2-3 departments for focused comparison

### Data Enhancements:
1. **Real response rate** - Once response data available in Review interface
2. **Time ranges** - Filter department analytics by date
3. **Source breakdown** - Department performance by review source
4. **Agent breakdown** - See top agents within each department
