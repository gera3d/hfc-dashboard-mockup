# Chart Data Fixes - What Was Wrong & How We Fixed It

## 🐛 Problems Identified

### 1. **Satisfaction Trend Chart** - Flat Line with Drops
**Problem**: Chart showed 100% satisfaction with sudden drops to 0%

**Root Cause**: 
- Including days with ZERO reviews in the calculation
- Days with no reviews = 0/0 = undefined/NaN or showed as 0%
- Created unrealistic spikes and valleys

**Fix**:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Included ALL days, even with 0 reviews
return dailyMetrics.map(day => {...})

// AFTER: Only include days that have reviews
return dailyMetrics
  .filter(day => day.total > 0) // ✅ Skip days with no data
  .map(day => {...})
```

**Result**: Smooth, realistic satisfaction trend line showing actual customer sentiment

### 2. **Agent Performance Rankings** - Hard to Read
**Problem**: Couldn't see both metrics clearly (avg rating 1-5 was tiny next to review counts of 100+)

**Root Cause**:
- Showing raw avg_rating (1-5 scale) alongside total reviews (could be 500+)
- The 1-5 bar was invisible next to larger numbers

**Fix**:
```typescript
// Scale avg_rating (1-5) to (20-100) for visibility
avg_rating: agent.avg_rating * 20, // ✅ Makes it visible
avg_rating_display: agent.avg_rating, // ✅ Keep original for tooltip
```

**Tooltip Fix**:
```typescript
// Show the REAL rating in tooltip, not scaled version
formatter={(value, name, props) => {
  if (name === 'avg_rating') 
    return [props.payload.avg_rating_display.toFixed(2), 'Avg Rating']
}}
```

**Legend Update**:
- Changed from "Avg Rating (scaled)" to "Avg Rating (out of 5)"
- More intuitive for the owner

**Result**: 
- Both bars are now visible and comparable
- Tooltip shows real rating values
- Easy to identify high volume + high quality agents

### 3. **Department Performance Comparison** - Only One Department
**Problem**: Only showed "Consent" department (which isn't even a real department)

**Root Causes**:
- Not filtering out departments with 0 reviews
- Scale issue: Volume bars were huge, rating line was invisible
- Missing dual Y-axis configuration

**Fixes**:
```typescript
// 1. Filter out empty departments
.filter(d => d.total > 0) // ✅ Only show departments with data

// 2. Sort by volume to show busiest first
.sort((a, b) => b.total - a.total)

// 3. Limit to top 10 for readability
.slice(0, 10)

// 4. Add proper dual Y-axis
<YAxis yAxisId="left" /> // For volume bars
<YAxis yAxisId="right" domain={[0, 5]} ticks={[0,1,2,3,4,5]} /> // For rating line

// 5. Increase chart height for rotated labels
<div className="h-80"> // Was h-72, now h-80
height={120} // X-axis height for angled labels
```

**Legend Fix**:
```typescript
formatter={(value) => {
  if (value === 'total') return 'Review Volume'
  if (value === 'avg_rating') return 'Avg Rating (out of 5)'
}}
```

**Result**:
- Shows all active departments (top 10)
- Blue bars show volume on left axis
- Green line shows quality on right axis (properly scaled 0-5)
- Can compare both metrics easily

## 📊 Data Quality Improvements

### What the Charts Now Show:

**Satisfaction Trend**:
- ✅ Smooth trend line (no weird spikes)
- ✅ Only shows days with actual data
- ✅ Red benchmark at 80% for comparison
- ✅ Clear view of improving/declining service

**Agent Performance**:
- ✅ All agents ranked by volume
- ✅ Both metrics visible (purple = volume, green = quality)
- ✅ Easy to spot: high volume + low rating = needs coaching
- ✅ Tooltips show real ratings (not scaled)

**Department Comparison**:
- ✅ Shows all active departments (up to 10)
- ✅ Blue bars = review volume (left axis)
- ✅ Green line = avg rating (right axis, 0-5 scale)
- ✅ Easy to identify departments needing attention

**Problem Spotlight**:
- ✅ Shows % of low (1-2 star) reviews per department
- ✅ Color coded: Red = high risk (>10%), Orange = monitor
- ✅ Sorted by worst first
- ✅ Actionable for immediate fixes

## 🎯 What You Should See Now:

### Satisfaction Trend:
- Smooth green area chart
- Most values should be between 70-95%
- Some natural variation day-to-day
- Red dashed line at 80% for comparison

### Agent Performance:
- 10 agents listed (or however many you have)
- Two bars per agent:
  - Purple (Reviews Handled) - varies widely
  - Green (Avg Rating) - should be roughly similar heights
- Hover shows real numbers

### Department Comparison:
- Multiple departments displayed
- Blue bars show volume (bigger = more reviews)
- Green dots connected by line show rating (higher = better)
- Should see variety in both metrics

### Problem Spotlight:
- Sorted list of departments
- Shows % that are 1-2 stars
- Red bars = >10% (urgent)
- Orange bars = <10% (monitor)

---

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working:

1. **Check Satisfaction Trend**: Should be mostly stable, not flat at 100%
2. **Check Agent List**: Should show multiple agents, not just 1-2
3. **Check Departments**: Should show 5-10 departments, not just one
4. **Hover Tooltips**: Should show sensible numbers (ratings 1-5, not 20-100)

## 💡 Why These Fixes Matter:

### For Decision Making:
- ❌ **Before**: Data was misleading or invisible
- ✅ **After**: Clear, actionable insights

### For Agent Management:
- ❌ **Before**: Couldn't compare volume vs quality
- ✅ **After**: Easy to spot coaching opportunities

### For Department Strategy:
- ❌ **Before**: Only saw one department
- ✅ **After**: Compare all product lines

### For Problem Identification:
- ✅ **New**: Immediate visibility into where problems are concentrated

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Refresh the browser** to see the fixed charts
2. **Test with filters** to ensure data updates correctly
3. **Hover over data points** to verify tooltip values make sense
4. **Look for patterns** you couldn't see before

If you still see issues:
- Check the browser console for errors
- Verify Google Sheets data is loading
- Make sure date range filter isn't excluding all data
- Try refreshing the cached data with the sync button
